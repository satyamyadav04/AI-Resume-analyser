# 📌 Project Overview

The **AI Resume Analyzer & Ranker** is an intelligent recruitment solution that helps recruiters and HR professionals efficiently screen, analyze, and rank resumes based on a given Job Description (JD).

Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **semantic similarity search**, the system evaluates candidate profiles, calculates match scores, and ranks applicants according to their relevance.

This significantly reduces manual effort while improving hiring accuracy and efficiency.

# ⚙️ Installation

## **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Resume-Analyzer.git

cd AI-Resume-Analyzer
```

## **2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment**

### Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## **3️⃣ Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Deployment

This project is configured to run as a Streamlit application with the app entry point:

```text
frontend/app.py
```

Use Python 3.11 for deployment and set `DATABASE_URL` to your PostgreSQL connection string. The app creates its tables automatically on first launch.

For production hosting, make sure uploaded resumes and generated files are stored in persistent storage or object storage, because ephemeral hosts can lose locally written files after redeploys.

Optional email notifications require the `ATS_SMTP_*` environment variables (or your hosting platform secrets) and should not be committed to source control.

The repository includes the sample challenge dataset used by the Resume Analysis workflow; the larger `candidates.jsonl` file is not required for deploy-safe runs when it is not bundled.
